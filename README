This is a Linux Bash script released under GPL v2.0 license.

This script will download the song we want from goear.com trying
to find the best match possible, in other words, the right song
and version of the song.

How to use it
+++++++++++++

   ./GoearBestMatch options "songTitle [] Artist"

   OPTIONS:
      -h      Shows script help
      -b      Searches for the songtitle and artist together.
      -n      Searches for the songtitle and uses the artist to improve matching
              Recommended if -b fails at finding a match

	example: ./GoearBestMatch -b "Pruebalo [] sfdk"

++++++++
Wrappers
++++++++

Some of GoearBestMatch filters were developed to improve 
matching of Dance music. That's why the first wrapper for this script
is called 51chart.sh

Just put 51chart.sh and GoearBestMatch.sh in the same folder, better if
we use an empty one. Then execute 51chart:
./51chart

It will find the 51chart hits from maxima.fm Spanish Dance Radio Station 
titles and artist of the moment and tell GoearBestMatch to download them.

Please fell free to develop other wrappers and submit them at Github.
